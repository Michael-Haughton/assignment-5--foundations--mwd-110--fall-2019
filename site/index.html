      The ten Principles of design were created by Dieter Rams who was a German industrial designer.
      he always had an unobtrusive approach and believed that "less but better" way of think creates better design.
      This type of thinking was what made his timeless quality in his products have such great influence in the design of many products,
      which also secured Rams worldwide recognition and appreciation. You can click the rules at the top of the page to see what each rule
      is and their meaning.
